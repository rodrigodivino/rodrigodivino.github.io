<h1>VAST Challenge 2019 - Disaster in St. Himark!</h1>

<p>
  The VAST Challenge (Visual Analytics Science and Technology Challenge) is a   
  annual data analysis challenge. The VAST Challenge 2019 was hosted at    IEEE
  VIS conference in Vancouver.
</p>

<p>
  In 2019, the challenge was to help a fictional city cope with an earthquake.
  The inhabitants have applications in which they can report the level of
  destruction, and the decision makers of the city want to analyze this data in
  real time to direct efforts to the right plaes, even in the face of uncertain
  data
</p>

<p>
  My solution to this challenge was awarded the title   
  <b>"Award for Supporting Situation Awareness and Anomaly Detection"</b>
  The submission consists of a customized dashboard for monitoring the data in
  real time:
</p>

      alt="A tela principal da submissão para o VAST Challenge 2019" />
    <figcaption>The main view of the VAST Challenge 2019 dashboard</figcaption>
  </figure>

</div>

<p>
  The Dashboard contains four views connected by interactions. It is possible to
  filter data over time or by measurements, which allows analysts to answer the
  critical questions that the situation requires.
</p>

<p>
  The submission accompanied a video, in which I describe each view and the   
  interconnected interactions.

  In Vancouver, in addition to the oral presentation, a poster was placed in the
  hall of the conference:
